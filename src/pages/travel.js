              <p>
              Atlanta is the largest of the city's three commercial districts and is the location of many corporate or regional headquarters; city, county, state and federal government facilities; Georgia State University; sporting venues; and most of Atlanta's tourist attractions.
              </p>

              <p>
              Most visitors' journeys begin in Centennial Olympic Park district, the epicenter of downtown life. From its inspiring attractions such as Georgia Aquarium, SkyView Ferris Wheel, World of Coca-Cola, CNN Center and Center for Civil and Human Rights to year-round sporting events at the Georgia Dome and Philips Arena, there's always something going on in Atlanta. 
              </p>

              
              <p>
              The Convention & Entertainment District is where big events and family fun meet. Neighboring Fairlie-Poplar puts world-renowned performances center stage. And Castleberry Hill provides the perfect blend of eclectic artistry and city spirit.
