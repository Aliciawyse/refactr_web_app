# refactr.tech gatsby project

REFACTR.TECH is a 3 day conference showcasing voices of marginalized people & allies on tech topics, diversity, inclusion and intersectionality. The current [website](http://refactr.tech/) is interactive, but it's arduous to maintain. As the conference grows its list of talks and workshops, the contents of the website have to be updated manually. 

The goals are to:

- create an identical version of the current website using GatsbyJS. 
- use grapql and the Airtable API so that updates to the conference data in Airtable seamlessly translate over to the GatsbyJS project.
